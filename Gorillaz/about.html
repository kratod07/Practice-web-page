            <p class="parragraph">Gorillaz is an English virtual band created in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. The gang is made up of four fictional members: 2-D, Noodle, Murdoc Niccals, and Russel Hobbs.
                Most of his songs, along with his entire fictional universe, are presented through animated music videos, traditional animation and computer animation, interviews and short animated shorts. 
                In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical member of the band.
                Producer and A&R executive Remi Kabaka Jr. would begin collaborating with the group in 2016 after providing the voice of Russel Hobbs for several years and would be named an official member alongside Albarn and Hewlett in 2019 in the Gorillaz documentary.</p>
            <p class="parragraph">Damon Albarn and cartoonist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, the band Coxon and Albarn had just formed.
                The interview was published in Deadline magazine, which published Tank Girl, a comic strip created by Hewlett. Hewlett initially believed that Albarn was, in his own words, "a doofus", despite being known to the band, they did not get along, especially when Hewlett began dating Coxon's ex-girlfriend, Jane Olliver.
                Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett shared a house in London's Westbourne Grove in 1997.
                Hewlett had ended his relationship with Olliver and Albarn had done the same with Elastica's Justine Frischmann.
                While Hewlett and Albarn were watching MTV, they got the idea to create the band.</p>
